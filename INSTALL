Build config
------------
The default build config is resolved by qmake. To build Communi
specifically in release or debug mode, you may pass additional
"-config release" or "-config debug" parameters to qmake, respectively.
Furthermore, in order to build a static version of Communi, you
may pass "-config static".

ICU vs. uchardet
----------------
The default encoding detection backend is automatically chosen as
ICU on systems that support pkg-config and the appropriate package
is available. Otherwise uchardet, which is bundled with Communi and
therefore requires no special build configuration, is used. You may
also manually choose between the two by passing addition "-config icu"
or "-config uchardet" parameters to qmake.

Example
-------
A static library in release mode using uchardet as backend:
qmake -config static -config release -config uchardet
